An Mp3 player, implementing a linked list structured methods.
To compile, please have the desired songs attached, within the folder containing the src file and compile then run.
Make sure you use the jl1.0.1.jar file in your project structure.
I believe if you are not using a IDE you must:
Compilation: javac -cp jl1.0.1.jar Mp3Player.java
Execution:   java -cp ./jl1.0.1.jar:. Mp3Player

Else open in IDE and specify dependencies, as the jl1.0.1.jar file.
